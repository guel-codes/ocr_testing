# OCR Test
This is a wuick project to get an OCR (optical character recognition) library up and running. In order to do this I leveraged a library call easyocr. 

## Goals
- Print out all text that is found and the percentage of confidence in that text.
- Try this on a video file to see if I can track changing values.
